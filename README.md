# open-orders
Scripts used to quickly filter through excel files

# Description
A third party organization manages inventories for multiple locations. Workers at each location receive a daily spreadsheet with a list of all open orders. This project will develop a Python script to automate the process of filtering and collecting information. 

# Goals
* Identify all orders that are listed as 'allocated'.
* For allocated orders, identify all orders that can be filled based on the location's existing inventory.
* Present the information in an easy to read format that makes the picking process easy.
